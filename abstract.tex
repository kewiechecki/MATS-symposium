Identification of a model's latent concepts requires identifying both learned features and learned generalizations.
I introduce a novel maximum entropy clustering method based on self-supervised denoising.
Preliminary results show the clusters can be used to reconstruct output classifications of the model and incorporating this method into an SAE increases feature independence.
Visualization of centrod values suggests that these clusters are interpretable.
